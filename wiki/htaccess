# If you want your URLs to look like this:
#   http://mymachine.com/wiki/page1
# instead of like this:
#   http://mymachine.com/egroupware/wiki/index.php?page=page1
# and you're running Apache, then customize and add
# the below lines to your .htaccess file, or
# copy this file to .htaccess.  Note that your
# Apache web server needs to be setup to read
# .htaccess files and allow use of the RewriteEngine
# directive (AllowOverride FileInfo). 
# you have to change the RewriteBase directive to the URI 
# of your wiki install.

RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /wiki
RewriteRule ^([^/]*)$ ../egroupware/wiki/index.php?page=$1&{QUERY_STRING}
