# This file can be copyied as .htaccess to your document root
# to support Mac or iPhone clients to autodetec CalDAV and CardDAV
# (currently Addressbook does NOT allow to specify our groupdav.php 
#  URL manually).
#
# Please note: 
# - your Apache web server needs to be setup to read .htaccess files and 
#   allow use of the RewriteEngine directive (AllowOverride FileInfo). 
# - you need to replace /egroupware with your EGroupware URL path eg. /egw
