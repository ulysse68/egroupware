Move this directory to the root directory of your egroupware
installation and go into setup and install it like a egroupware
application.
Inside sitemgr, you have to go to 'Manage site-wide module properties'
and check if the module guestbook appears in the list of selectable
modules, otherwise click on 'Register new modules' to register it. If
it still does not appear, check if the file
class.module_guestbook.inc.php is in the directory sitemgr/modules.
Once you have added the module guestbook to the liste of permitted
modules, select it in one of the select lists on the right, and click
on "Configure". In the following interface you can define guestbooks,
your contributors can choose from. There is a checkbox for configuring if
contributors can define their own guestbooks.
All guestbooks are accessible for contributors everywhere on your
site. In the real world, it would be necessary to make them visible
only on specific categories, or for specific content areas.
